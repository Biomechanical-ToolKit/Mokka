# - Try to find Qt5
# Once done this will define
#
#  Qt5_ROOT_PATH: Root path for the CMake folder included in Qt5
#  Qt5_CMAKE_PATH: Root path for the CMake folder included in Qt5
#  Qt5_FOUND: Simple flag to indicate if Qt5 was found or not
#
# Note: This only attempt to add the path in the variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
#       to be able to use after the CMake scripts provided by Qt5.
