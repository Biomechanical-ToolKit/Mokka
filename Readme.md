Mokka
=====

Open-source and cross-platform software to easily analyze biomechanical data

Overview
--------

This branch is only a proof of concept to show that we can have a Python console within an application based on Qt5 and PythonQt and access to some C++ methods/constants from the Python console. This branch could be also the basis for *Mokka2*: A reimplementation of (Mokka)[http://b-tk.googlecode.com/svn/web/mokka/index.html] based on Qt5, including a Python console, a plugin/extension system, the same features than before but refactorized for a better modularity, and... Who knows? 

Prerequisites
-------------

* CMake 2.8.9 or above
* Qt 5.1 or above
* (patched-5)[https://github.com/Alzathar/PythonQt] version of PythonQt

Build instructions
------------------

```
git clone git://github.com/Biomechanical-ToolKit/Mokka.git ./Mokka.git
cd Mokka.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DPYTHONQT_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/path/to/PythonQt/src/folder -DPYTHONQT_GENERATED_CPP_DIR:PATH=/path/to/PythonQt/generated_cpp_50/folder -DPYTHONQT_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/path/to/PythonQt/library ..
make
```
